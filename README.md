Exploratory Analyses on '10 guys 1 cup' FF League's 2019 Season

Lots of exploration on what the ESPN Fantasy Football JSON object provides. But not everything! Since it's a huge object.

There's exploratory analysis on the season, such as performance, luck, importing ESPN JSON info, and the quality and visualization of ESPN's new Final Projected Rankings section.

Final Projected Rankings_10Guys.xlsx is the source Excel sheet for what ESPN projects as the final rank for every team. It's used as source data for both main notebooks within both folders.

Projected Rankings:
  Final Projected Rankings.R is the raw script to not have to look at a Jupyter notebook.
  Final Projected Rankings.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook output with Data Frames, graphics, and explanations.

2019 Exploratory Analysis:
  FF_source_data.py is the raw python script to not have to look at a Jupyter notebook.
  10 Guys One Cup 2019 Season Analysis.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook output with Data Frames and graphics and, of course, explanations.
